* Gotchas
- .gitignore isn't retroactive(?). That means, if i already track
  something, then in order to activate gitingonre instruction on that

which is placed in the root.
Git file, special characters like % and ~ have special meanings and
need to be escaped to be treated as literal characters (i'm not sure about tilde).
