Explain how sudo works.

** Answer
Sudo executable has a special permission bit that spawns a proccess with a UID
of a user who owns it (which is usually /0/ aka /root/). At an attempt to execute
the binary sudo looks at a sudoers file to check permissions for using sudo for
a current user who is currently executing the binary.  After the sudo usage a
special timestamp file is created with a life duration identical to a time to
which is the user allowed to use sudo without a password. Sudo checks this file
for its existence when decides you to prompt for a password or not.

** Notes
